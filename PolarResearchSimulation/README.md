# Polar Research Simulation

This project is a gamified simulation inspired by Türkiye’s polar research initiatives.
Rather than focusing on traditional gameplay, the primary goal of this project was to simulate environmental conditions, decision-making under uncertainty, and system-based interactions in extreme climates.

The project was designed as an educational and exploratory system, emphasizing how abstract variables such as temperature, visibility, and risk can influence player decisions within a simulated environment.

## Motivation

I was interested in exploring how real-world scientific challenges—such as polar research—could be represented through interactive systems.
Instead of recreating real locations visually, I focused on modeling the underlying processes researchers face: limited resources, unpredictable conditions, and the need for informed decision-making.

## Core Systems

- Environmental condition simulation (temperature, weather variability, visibility)
- Player decision-impact system
- Risk and safety evaluation logic
- Event-driven feedback loops
- Resource-based progression model

## Computer Science Focus

Although the project was implemented primarily using Unreal Engine Blueprints, the design emphasizes core computer science principles:
- State-based logic for environmental conditions
- Event-driven system architecture
- Modular system separation
- Abstraction of real-world processes into interactive models

The project prioritizes system clarity and logical structure over visual fidelity.

## Why This Project Matters

This simulation represents my interest in using computer science as a tool for modeling complex real-world systems.
By focusing on simulation and system design rather than polished gameplay, the project reflects how interactive software can be used for education, research, and exploration beyond entertainment.
